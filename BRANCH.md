# About "master" branch
## General
This branch ~~is switching~~ has been switched to an Ivy Bridge, `Intel Core i7-3632QM` CPU with Intel's `HD4000` onboard graphics, since as of 7th September 2023 the main branch is using the `Intel HD2000` Graphics, which are **not supported** in any OSX/macOS.

I ~~will~~ have ported this repository to `HD4000` Graphics as of beginning of 2024.

## Where will my HD2000 EFI be?
The HD2000 compatible EFI was be moved to a separate `gfx2000-legacy` branch. The `gfx4000` branch was be merged into the `master` branch.
